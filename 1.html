 <h2>WOMEN</h2>
 A woman must have money and<strong> a <u>room</u> of her own</strong> if she is to write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf" target="_blank" title="virginia woolf">fiction</a>.
 <p> Suppose, for instance, that men were only represented in literature as the lovers of women,
 and were never the friends of men, soldiers, thinkers, dreamers; how few parts in the plays of Shakespeare
 could be allotted to them; how literature would suffer!</p>
 <img src="ny.jpg" width="100%">
 <p>We might perhaps have most of Othello; and a good deal of Antony; but no Caesar,
 no Brutus, no Hamlet, no Lear, no Jaques--literature would be incredibly impoverished,
 as indeed literature is impoverished beyond our counting by the doors that have been shut upon women.</p>
