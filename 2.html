 <h2>WRITER</h2>
 <p> In Finland, the beginnings of its modern popularity among young girls stands as something of a mystery, though it is known
   that for some while the community flourished secretly online. Today, there are not just practitioners but coaches, competitions,
    judges. Enthusiasts assign their horses names, breeds and genders, and along the usual displays of cantering, trotting and galloping,
     meetings will cover everything from in-depth discussions of grooming, bloodlines, temperament, and, on at least one occasion,
     a two-part dressage routine choreographed to a song by the rapper Nelly.
